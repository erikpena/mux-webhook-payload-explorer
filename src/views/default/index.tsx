    <H1Styled>What is this?</H1Styled>
    <p>The Webhook Payload Explorer is a way to view example webhook payloads for uploads that would be sent from Mux to better understand the properties that will be available.</p>
    <p>The menu represents a grouping of webhook events based on the common <strong>use-case</strong>.  Each use-case section header briefly describes the use-case itself as well as some key points that should be considered for the events.  The set of events underneath the use-case header are numbered based on sequence for which they are sent out.</p>
    <p>These example payloads will reference ids (that don't actually exist).  Refer to the following table to get an idea of what id values to expect in the samplesâ€”</p>
