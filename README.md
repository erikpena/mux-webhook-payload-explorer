# Summary

The Webhook Payload Explorer is a way to view example webhook payloads for uploads that would be sent from Mux to better understand the properties that will be available.

The menu represents a grouping of webhook events based on the common **use-case**. Each use-case section header briefly describes the use-case itself as well as some key points that should be considered for the events. The set of events underneath the use-case header are numbered based on sequence for which they are sent out.
